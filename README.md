# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

The code you have is set up correctly to show how the integration with the backend would work, including form submission and transaction handling. To make it fully functional, you'll need to connect it to your backend service. Below is a summary of the steps and what each part of the code does:

Explanation of the Code(DATA OFFERS,BINGWA MINUTES/SMS AND OFFER FORM JS

Component Structure:

The component uses React hooks to manage state (useState) and shows different offers for minutes and SMS.
When the user clicks "Buy Now," it shows a form for the user to enter their phone number.
After the form is submitted, it shows a confirmation popup asking for a PIN.

Form Submission and Transaction Handling:

The form data (phone number and amount) is sent to the backend using Axios when the user submits the form.
The backend is expected to process the transaction (e.g., initiate an STK push for payment).

Backend Integration:

The handleTransactionWithBackend function is a placeholder for the actual transaction handling logic.
The backend should handle the transaction, initiate the STK push, and return a response indicating success or failure.

STK Handling Integration: Added state variables (processing, error) and updated logic (handleFormSubmit) to handle STK Push integration or payment processing. This includes Axios for making HTTP POST requests to your Django backend's transaction endpoint.


Axios Integration: Import Axios and use it to make HTTP requests (get for fetching packages and post for handling transactions) to your Django backend.

fetchPackagesFromBackend: Simulates fetching packages from the Django backend. Replace the URL (https://your-backend-api/packages) with your actual backend API endpoint.

handleTransactionWithBackend: Simulates handling the transaction with the Django backend. Replace the URL (https://your-backend-api/transaction) with your actual backend API endpoint.
